I found the maximum value of array sub sequence by using do while loop ,then i verified the maximum value of the sub sequence by enforcing assert statements.

Then i found the start and end index of the array sub sequence and also verfied the sub sequence values.

Then i found the array size of sub sequence and verified it.

The program can be tested by adding some elements out of size.In this program i declared maximum and minimum size of elements as 50 and -50.
For example if we add S[7]as 100
then it produces text of failed assertion: assert(((S[j]<50)&&(S[j]>-(50)))).

If there is any error ,the program will produce that the assertions are violated.So all the errors are catched using program logic itself.

Below are the outputs produced by running program:

 
Output 1 :
S= [ 0,  0, 1, -1, 1, 0, 0, 1 , 0 , 0]
The maximum sum value of the sub sequence of array is : 2
The start index of the sub sequence is: 0
The end index of the sub sequence is: 7
The sequence is:   0,  0,  1, -1,  1,  0,   0,  1
      
Output 2 :
S= [ 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 4 ]
The maximum sum value of the sub sequence of array is : 5
The start index of the sub sequence is: 0
The end index of the sub sequence is: 9
The sequence is:  0, 0, 1,  0, 0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 4
  
Output 3 :
S= [-1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1, 1, -1, 0, 0, -2, 0, -1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
The maximum sum value of the sub sequence of array is : 3
The start index of the sub sequence is: 16
The end index of the sub sequence is: 18
The sequence is:  1, 1, 1
     
	 
Output 4:
S=[-3, 0, -1, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, -1, -3]
The maximum sum value of the sub sequence of array is : 0
The start index of the sub sequence is: 1
The end index of the sub sequence is: 1
The sequence is:       0
